# ClickCounterApp
Simple Java GUI app to demo how to create a button that counts clicks when pressed.

HOW IT WORKS:
Pressing the 'Click me' button will count and add every click you make. 

NOTE: -Reset button doesn't work yet. At the moment it just counts clicks when pressed, 
       just like the 'Click me' button.
      -Known bug: When the counter reaches double digits, the number will be hidden by an ellipsis. 
       Workaround: Resize the window slightly, and the number of click will be revealed.
