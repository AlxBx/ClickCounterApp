# ClickCounterApp
Simple Java GUI app that demoes how to create a button that counts clicks when pressed.

HOW IT WORKS:
Pressing the 'Click me' button will count and add every click you make. 

NOTE: -Reset button doesn't work yet. At the moment it just counts clicks when pressed, 
       just like the 'Clik me' button.
      
      -Known bug: When the counter reaches double digits, the number will be hiddin by 
       elypsis. Workaround: Resize the window slightly and the number of click will be revealed.
